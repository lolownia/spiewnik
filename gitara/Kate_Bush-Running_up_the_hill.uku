                       C D Em 
It doesn't hurt me
                       C D Em 
Do you wanna feel how it feels 
                       C D Em 
Do you wanna know, know that it doesn't hurt me

Do you wanna hear about the deal that I'm making

And if I only could

I'd make a deal with God
    Em
And I'd get him to swap our places

Be running up that road
                    D
Be running up that hill
                    Em
Be running up that building
           C   Bm  Em
If I only could

You don't wanna hurt me

But see how deep the bullet lies
                 C D Em 
Unaware I'm tearing you a thunder
                 C D Em 
There is thunder in our hearts
                 C D Em   
Is there so much hate for the ones we love
                           C  Em   Am
Oh, tell me we both matter don't we
                            C  Em     Am 
  ItÂ´s you and me  you and me won't be unhappy
