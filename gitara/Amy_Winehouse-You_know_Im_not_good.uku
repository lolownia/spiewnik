Intro: Dm   

Dm    Gm   
Meet you downstairs in the bar and hurt
A7    Dm   
Your rolled up sleeves and your skull t-shirt
Dm    Gm   
You say why did you do with him today
A7    Dm   
And sniffed me out like I was Tanqueray

Gm   
Cause you're my fella my guy
E7   
Hand me your Stella and fly
F   
By the time I'm out the door
E7    A7   
You tear me down like Roger Moore




Chorus:

Dm    Am   
I cheated myself
E7    Am   
Like I knew I would
Dm    Am   
I told you I was trouble
E7    Am   
You know that I'm no good







Dm    Gm   
Upstairs in bed with my ex boy
A7    Dm   
He's in a place but I can ��t get joy
Dm    Gm   
Thinking on you in the final throes
A7    Dm   
This is when my buzzer goes

Gm   
Run out to meet you chips and pitta
E7   
You say when we married
cause you're not bitter
F   
There'll be none of him no more
E7    A7   
I cried for you on the kitchen floor

Chorus

Dm    Am    E7    Am    (2X) - riff do Sax



Dm    Gm   
Sweet reunion Jamaica and Spain
A7    Dm   
We're like how we were again
Dm    Gm   
I'm in the tub you on the seat
A7    Dm   
Lick your lips as I soap my feet

Gm   
Then you notice likkle carpet burn
E7   
My stomach drop yeah and my guts churn
F   
You shrug and it's the worst
E7    A7   
To truly stuck the knife in first

Chorus(2X)

Dm    Am    E7    Am    (2X - riff do Sax and fade 0ut)
